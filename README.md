__Branchless__

The client is Branchless, a non-physical bank that seeks to capitalize on the proliferation of online banking usage. Banking online is at an all time high, so this firm has a strong chance of gaining a large customer base, provided that they implement web applications that are seamless and higlhy realiable. Their potential weakness could stem from a underestimation on how many people value going to physical bank locations. There should be an importance placed on targeting millenials and young professionals becasue those are the two demographics who are most likely to adopt online banking early and subsuqently inform their parents or older relatives.

To appeal to the target demographic mentioned earlier, we will seek to develop a native app that has a seamless interface and stable backend framework to create and keep a strong user base. Branchless' paperless operation will also appeal to a more eco concious world and its always open availabity will appeal to those who have odd hours.
